# AI-Powered-Car-Parking-Space-Detection-using-YOLOv8-OpenCV
This project is an intelligent parking space detection system that uses YOLOv8 deep learning and OpenCV to automatically identify occupied and vacant parking spots from images or video streams. 


1️⃣ WHAT THIS PROJECT IS

This is an AI-based parking space detection system that automatically tells:

Which parking spaces are occupied

Which parking spaces are empty

How many slots are available in real time

It works on:

📷 Images

🎥 Videos

(Can be extended to live CCTV feeds)

It uses:

YOLOv8 (Deep Learning) → to detect vehicles

OpenCV (Computer Vision) → to draw, analyze, and display results

2️⃣ REAL-WORLD PROBLEM IT SOLVES

Traditional Problems:

❌ Manual parking checks
❌ No real-time availability
❌ Human error
❌ Traffic congestion

Our Solution:

✅ Automatic detection
✅ Real-time results
✅ Visual guidance
✅ Smart parking readiness

3️⃣ TECHNOLOGIES USED (WHY EACH IS USED)

🔹 Python

Easy to implement AI + CV

Industry standard for ML

🔹 OpenCV

Image & video processing

Drawing parking boxes

Mouse interaction

🔹 YOLOv8

State-of-the-art object detection

Detects vehicles accurately

Very fast (real-time)

🔹 NumPy

Save and load parking slot coordinates

Efficient data handling

5️⃣ HOW PARKING SPACES ARE DEFINED (IMPORTANT)

Step 1: Manual Selection (Once Only)

User draws rectangles using the mouse

Each rectangle = 1 parking slot

Coordinates are saved in a file

Why Manual?

✔ Works for any parking lot
✔ No need for fixed camera angles
✔ One-time setup only

Saved As:
parking_slots.npy


This file stores:

(x, y, width, height)

6️⃣ VEHICLE DETECTION (YOLOv8 EXPLAINED)

YOLO = You Only Look Once

YOLOv8 detects objects in one pass, making it very fast.

What YOLO Detects:

Cars

Motorcycles

Buses

Trucks

How Detection Works:

Frame is passed to YOLO

YOLO returns:

Bounding box

Class ID

Confidence score

Only vehicle classes are kept

Example Detection Box:
(x1, y1) → top-left
(x2, y2) → bottom-right

7️⃣ OCCUPANCY DECISION LOGIC (CORE ALGORITHM)
Key Idea:

👉 If a vehicle overlaps a parking space → OCCUPIED

Mathematical Logic:

For each parking space:

IF vehicle_box intersects parking_box
THEN occupied = True
ELSE occupied = False

Overlap Condition:
x1 < px + width AND
x2 > px AND
y1 < py + height AND
y2 > py


This is bounding box intersection logic.

8️⃣ COLOR CODING SYSTEM
Color	Meaning
🟩 Green	Empty parking slot
🟥 Red	Occupied parking slot
🟪 Purple	Slot being drawn

This makes the output human-readable instantly.


9️⃣ REAL-TIME STATISTICS

Displayed on screen:

Free: 7 / 20


Which means:

Total slots = 20

Free slots = 7

Occupied = 13

This updates frame-by-frame in video mode.

🔟 USER CONTROLS (VERY IMPORTANT)
Mouse Controls

Left click + drag → Draw parking slot

Keyboard Controls
Key	Function
S	Save parking slots
D	Run detection
Q	Quit program


1️⃣1️⃣ IMAGE MODE WORKFLOW

Load image

User draws parking slots

Press S → save layout

Press D → detect vehicles

See result (green/red)

This mode is ideal for:

Testing

Setup

Calibration

1️⃣2️⃣ VIDEO MODE WORKFLOW

Load video

Slots auto-loaded

YOLO runs on each frame

Slots update in real time

Statistics update live

Used for:

CCTV footage

Parking monitoring

1️⃣3️⃣ FILE EXPLANATION

File	Purpose
parking_ai.py	Main logic
parking_slots.npy	Saved parking coordinates
carPark.jpg	Sample image
carPark.mp4	Sample video

1️⃣4️⃣ ACCURACY & PERFORMANCE

Accuracy:

~90–95% with YOLOv8

Depends on:

Lighting

Camera angle

Occlusion

Performance:

Real-time on CPU

Faster with GPU (CUDA)

1️⃣5️⃣ LIMITATIONS 

❌ Occluded vehicles may be missed
❌ Extreme shadows can affect detection
❌ Manual slot marking required
❌ Fixed camera angle assumed

1️⃣6️⃣ POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS

✅ Add CSV analytics
✅ Add occupancy history graphs
✅ Add license plate recognition
✅ Cloud-based dashboard
✅ Mobile app integration
✅ IoT sensor fusion
